# Rescale_to_reference
1] In project directory another directory "data" created to store input data. I have 2 files of one sample analysis i.e. shuf.a.bed.gz and shuf.b.bed.gz downloaded from website - https://figshare.com/s/2d3d4d60a82de9cc3cc6 and stored it into data directory. These files unziped by using gunzip command. Also there is reference file data directory, we have rescale our data to that reference file.
